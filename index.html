                        <p>Spring is in the air! The flowers are in bloom, the chill is receding, and renewal is all around us. Why not take a break from cleaning out those dusty rafters and curl up with nine brand new stories from some of your favorite queerlit authors?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Every writer has an idea which has languished in a corner of their mind or in their drafts folder, sometimes for years on end. An idea that's just too good to completely discard, but which you don't know how to start or finish writing. Well, as it turns out, this year we had the perfect chance to do it! Several trans writers stepped up to the challenge, delved deep into their trove of unfinished products, and are now presenting you the results.</p>

                        <p>Ten different branches, one seed! See how the minds of ten different queer authors take the same prompt. As varied as we all are, different as paths could possibly be. With your purchase, you get access to ten stories: Superheroes and Villains, Monsters and Demons, Murder and Romance, Heartache and Growth, Euphoria and Dysphoria. They're united by the seed of one idea, but they all shine on their own!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>All stories included were inspired by the same prompt: Two people are hiding a secret from each other, but believe that the other has the same secret! But when the secrets are revealed, it turns out they aren't the same. When the truth is revealed to one or both, how does it change the way the characters see each other - and the world at large?</p>
